/**
 * Project tab registry — the single source of truth for which tabs exist
 * inside ProjectDetail, what capabilities gate them, and how they appear in
 * the role-editor picker. Adding a new tab is a single entry here.
 *
 * What this DOES drive:
 *   1. Tab strip visibility in ProjectDetail.tsx
 *   2. URL-direct-access "this section is restricted" gate
 *   3. Role-editor picker (Admin → Roles): label, description, sub-rows
 *
 * What this DOES NOT drive (kept per-tab because component shapes differ):
 *   - The actual `<TabComponent {...props} />` render — each tab takes a
 *     unique prop shape (hubWorkItems, sprints, pulseData, etc.) that's
 *     hard to make polymorphic without weakening types. The switch in
 *     ProjectDetail.tsx still handles that, but uses `canAccess(tab, ...)`
 *     from this file so the access logic stays here.
 *
 * To add a new tab:
 *   1. Add the capability key(s) to backend/capabilities.py.
 *   2. Add an entry to PROJECT_TABS below.
 *   3. Add a render block in ProjectDetail.tsx's `<Suspense>` body.
 *   4. (If sub-tabs are meaningful) add `picker.children` so admins can
 *      grant a subset from the role editor.
 *
 * The tab id MUST match the TabType in ProjectDetail.tsx so the switch
 * lines up.
