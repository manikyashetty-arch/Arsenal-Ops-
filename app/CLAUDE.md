# Frontend conventions

This file documents the patterns the `perf/request-timing-middleware` branch
established (or relies on) across the React 19 + TypeScript + Vite frontend.
**Read this before adding pages, mutations, or queries.** New code that
silently drops these patterns will introduce bugs we've already fixed once.

Pair this with `src/pages/CONVENTIONS.md`, which covers page-folder layout
specifically.

## Stack

- React 19.2 (concurrent rendering, react-hooks v6 ESLint rules active)
- TypeScript 5.9, `strict: true`
- Vite 7.2
- TanStack Query v5 (`@tanstack/react-query`)
- react-router-dom 7.13
- Tailwind + shadcn/ui + sonner
- ESLint flat config (`eslint.config.js`) + Prettier

CI runs `tsc --noEmit`, `npm run lint`, `npm run format:check`, unit tests, and
a generated-types drift check on every PR via `.github/workflows/lint.yml` (see
the CI section at the bottom). Loud but not blocking — failures show red but
don't gate merge unless added to branch protection.

## API types — generated from the backend

The backend's OpenAPI schema is the **source of truth** for API request/response
types. They are generated into `src/client/` by
[`@hey-api/openapi-ts`](https://heyapi.dev) and are **never hand-edited**.

We generate **types only** — no fetch SDK, no TanStack Query hooks, no Zod. The
app keeps its hand-rolled `apiFetch` (`src/lib/api.ts`) and the React Query
conventions below. The full architecture + rollout is in
`.plans/type-generation-pipeline-20260615.md`.

### The flow

```
backend Pydantic response model  (referenced by a route via response_model= or responses=)
  → backend/openapi.json          (committed snapshot; `python backend/scripts/export_openapi.py`)
  → app/src/client/types.gen.ts   (`npm run gen:types`)
  → feature code                  (import the generated type)
```

### Regenerating

```bash
npm run gen:types   # regenerate TS from the committed ../backend/openapi.json (no backend needed)
npm run gen:api     # re-dump the schema from the backend, THEN regenerate types
```

`gen:types` is backend-free and fully reproducible — it's the path most
contributors want. `gen:api` additionally runs `gen:schema`
(`cd ../backend && python scripts/export_openapi.py`), which invokes a bare
`python`: activate the backend venv first and use **Python 3.11** (the backend
uses `int | None` runtime syntax, needs 3.10+; CI pins 3.11). A different
interpreter or missing deps will fail — or worse, emit a schema that drifts from
CI.

The CI `api-types` job regenerates both and **fails on drift** — a PR that
changes a backend schema but doesn't commit the regenerated `backend/openapi.json`
+ `app/src/client` is stale by definition.

### Rules

- **Never hand-edit `src/client/**`** — it's eslint-ignored and overwritten on
  regen. Need a different shape? Change the backend schema and regenerate, or
  derive in feature code (`Pick`/`Omit` off the generated type). UI-only shapes
  that aren't API responses live next to their component.
- **A type only generates if a route references its schema** (via `response_model=`
  or `responses={200: {"model": X}}`). A Pydantic model no route references is
  invisible to the generator. So "add a type to the frontend" = "type the backend
  route."
- **Consuming:** `import type { UserResponse } from '@/client';`
- **Migration is in progress.** Today only a couple of entities consume generated
  types (`AuthContext` `User` → `UserResponse`; `WorkItemPanel` `AllDeveloper` →
  `DeveloperResponse`). Many API shapes are still hand-declared (see the F-T1 row
  below and `src/pages/CONVENTIONS.md` rules 5–6). When you touch one and a
  generated equivalent exists, prefer migrating it — but expect real null-handling
  fixes, since generated types correctly mark fields nullable that hand-types
  often read as non-null. Migrate entity-by-entity, not in bulk.

> Backend note: a route exposes its type to the generator via either
> `response_model=X` (runtime validation + the schema) or
> `responses={200: {"model": X}}` (the schema only, no runtime change). Existing
> typed routes (developers, auth, comments, admin) use `response_model=`; the
> projects / workitems / personal-tasks models added for this pipeline use
> `responses=` to avoid re-serializing a hand-built dict (which can change the
> wire format — e.g. int `0` → float `0.0`). Promoting those to `response_model=`
> is gated by the `backend/tests/contract/` byte-diff harness.

## React Query — the source of truth for server state

All pages were migrated to react-query in this branch. The provider is set
up in `App.tsx`; the client is configured in `src/lib/queryClient.ts`.

### Query keys

Use arrays, not strings. Conventions in use across the codebase:

| Key | Owner | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `['projects']` | ProjectsPage | All projects (list view) |
| `['project', id]` | ProjectDetail, ProjectBoard | Single project + dependents |
| `['workItems', filters]` | ProjectBoard | Filtered work-item list. **`filters` must be `useMemo`-stable** — see "Pitfalls" below |
| `['workItem', id, 'comments']` | ProjectBoard | Lazy comments per item |
| `['developers']` | Many | Project developers list |
| `['sprints', projectId]` | ProjectBoard | Project sprints |
| `['personalTasks']` | PersonalTasksPage | User's personal tasks |
| `['myTasks']` | ProjectsPage home widget | User's assigned work items across all projects |
| `['hubData', projectId, sub]` | ProjectDetail | ProjectHub sub-view data |
| `['admin', resource]` | AdminDashboard | One entry per admin tab |

If you add a new query key, pick a convention that's prefix-compatible with
`invalidateQueries({ queryKey: [<prefix>] })` for cross-cutting invalidation.

### Mutation pattern (current default: optimistic)

```ts
const mutation = useMutation({
  mutationFn: (vars) => apiFetch(`/api/...`, { method: 'PUT', body: ... }),
  onMutate: async (vars) => {
    await queryClient.cancelQueries({ queryKey: ['workItems'] }); // PREFIX, not exact
    const snapshot = queryClient.getQueryData(['workItems']);
    queryClient.setQueryData(['workItems'], (old) => /* optimistic write */);
    return { snapshot };
  },
  onError: (_err, _vars, ctx) => {
    if (ctx?.snapshot) queryClient.setQueryData(['workItems'], ctx.snapshot);
    toast.error('Failed to ...');
  },
  onSettled: () => {
    queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['workItems'] });
    queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['myTasks'] }); // see below
  },
});
```

### Cross-cutting invalidation rule

Work-item mutations **must invalidate both `['workItems']` and `['myTasks']`**.
The home page's "My Tasks" widget reads from `['myTasks']`, while the Board
reads from `['workItems']` — they share the same underlying data via
different endpoints. F12 in our audit fixed this for 5 sites; don't undo it.

For convenience the board defines a helper:

```ts
const invalidateWorkItems = () => {
  queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['workItems'] });
  queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ['myTasks'] });
};
```

### Direct cache writes (not state mirrors)

When you need to optimistically update a list, **write to the react-query
cache, do not mirror it with `useState`**:

```ts
// GOOD — single source of truth
const myTasks = myTasksQuery.data ?? [];
const patchMyTasksCache = (updater: (old: MyTask[]) => MyTask[]) =>
  queryClient.setQueryData<MyTask[]>(['myTasks'], (old) => updater(old ?? []));

// BAD — creates a parallel source of truth that drifts from the cache
const [myTasksLocal, setMyTasksLocal] = useState<MyTask[]>([]);
useEffect(() => setMyTasksLocal(myTasksQuery.data ?? []), [myTasksQuery.data]);
```

---

## TypeScript patterns

### Stabilize empty-default arrays

`data ?? []` in a query consumer creates a **new empty array every render**,
which busts downstream `useMemo`/`useEffect` dependencies:

```ts
// BAD: new [] reference each render
const items = query.data ?? [];

// GOOD: stable reference
const items = useMemo(() => query.data ?? [], [query.data]);
```

We applied this pattern in AdminDashboard for `employees`, `users`, and
`developerCapacities`. Cluster 4 F10 in the audit flagged the remaining
inconsistent applications.

### `ApiError instanceof` for status checks

`apiFetch` (in `src/lib/api.ts`) throws an `ApiError` with a `.status`
field on any non-2xx response. Inspect the type before reading status:

```ts
// GOOD
if (error instanceof ApiError && error.status === 403) { ... }

// BAD — the audit flagged this elsewhere
if ((error as any).status === 403) { ... }
```

Currently only `ProjectDetail.tsx` uses this pattern correctly. New code
should follow the same shape.

### Catch bindings

ES2019 optional catch binding is on. Prefer the shortest form:

```ts
try { ... } catch { ... }          // err unused — no binding
try { ... } catch (_err) { ... }    // err captured but intentionally unused
try { ... } catch (err) { ... }     // err actually used
```

The ESLint rule `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars` is configured to allow
`_`-prefixed identifiers and to ignore caught-error params entirely.

### `any` is a warning, not an error

`@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` is downgraded to **warn** in
`eslint.config.js`. Existing code uses `any` heavily for response payloads,
recharts callbacks, and drag-drop event types. Don't add new `any`s —
prefer `unknown` and narrow — but don't be forced into refactoring to
land a feature.

## React 19 / react-hooks v6 rules

The `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` and `react-hooks/purity` rules are
active. They forbid:

- Calling `setX(...)` synchronously inside `useEffect` (causes cascading
  renders). When you legitimately need this (e.g., URL→state sync), add a
  per-line `// eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/set-state-in-effect`
  with a one-sentence reason.
- Calling impure functions during render (`new Date()`, `Math.random()`,
  `Date.now()`). Wrap in `useMemo(..., [])` for once-per-mount, or use
  `useState(() => ({...}))` lazy initializer when the value seeds state.

Examples that exist:
- `TimelineView.tsx` uses `useState(() => ({...new Date()...}))` lazy init.
- `App.tsx` has one eslint-disable on a deliberate `setCountdown(300)`
  reset inside an effect.
- `ui/sidebar.tsx` has one eslint-disable on `Math.random()` in `useMemo`
  for non-deterministic skeleton widths.

### `useEffect` dependency arrays

ESLint enforces `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps`. Don't omit deps to "stop a
loop" — fix the root cause. Common patterns:

- React-query's `mutate` is stable across renders; safe to omit from deps.
- `setSearchParams` from react-router-dom is stable; safe to omit.
- `queryClient` is stable; safe to omit.

---

## Code splitting

`React.lazy` + `Suspense` is in use for route-level chunks (`App.tsx`) and
for heavy non-route components (`MermaidRenderer`, `ArchitectureEditor` in
`ProjectDetail.tsx`). When extracting a heavy sub-component (>500 LOC) that
isn't always rendered, consider lazy-loading it — but ONLY when the audit
or plan specifies so. Lazy-loading a small modal that opens on user click
adds chunk-load latency for no benefit.

---

## Dev login bypass

`POST /api/auth/dev-login` issues a JWT for `dev@local` (admin role) when
`DEV_AUTH_BYPASS=1` is set on the backend. The frontend probes
`/api/auth/dev-login/available` and conditionally renders a "Dev login"
button on the Login page.

Use this for local smoke testing when you don't have Google SSO env vars.
**Do not enable `DEV_AUTH_BYPASS` in any deployed environment.** The
endpoint returns 404 without the flag set, but defence in depth: also gate
the frontend probe with `import.meta.env.DEV` if you find time (audit I9).

## Things the audit flagged that we have NOT fixed yet

See `.branch-review/frontend-audit-20260513-1726.md` for the full list and
`.plans/split-monolithic-frontend-*.md` for the split plan. Highlights:

| Issue | Where | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `/admin` has no client-side role guard | `App.tsx:159` | Open |
| JWT stored in localStorage (XSS-readable) | `AuthContext.tsx`, `lib/api.ts` | Open |
| No global 401 handler — expired sessions fail silently | `lib/api.ts`, queryClient | Open |
| `WorkItem` declared 6×, `PersonalTask` 3× — no shared types module | many files | In progress — generated-types pipeline now exists (`src/client`, see "API types"); migrate each onto the generated type as you touch it |
| `new Date('YYYY-MM-DD')` UTC-parses to local-previous-day | 6 files | Open — fix exists (`parseLocalDate`) in 3 files, not shared |
| 4 fire-and-forget `apiFetch` mutations bypassing `useMutation` | `ProjectsPage`, `ProjectBoard` | Open — preserve current behaviour when extracting |
| No error boundaries anywhere | entire tree | Open |
| Kanban board + 4 modals are keyboard-inaccessible | `ProjectBoard.tsx` | Open |
| `console.log` left in 3 files (ProjectDetail, CalendarView, MermaidRenderer) | various | Open — add `'no-console': 'warn'` to ESLint when fixing |

When you touch files affected by these, **don't silently make them worse**.
If you can fix them in the same PR cheaply, do so and call it out. If
fixing them would expand scope, leave a `// TODO(audit-Fxx)` and move on.

## CI

`.github/workflows/lint.yml` runs four jobs:

- **Python (Ruff):** `setup-python` + pip-installs `backend/requirements.txt`
  (which pins `ruff==0.15.12`), then `ruff check backend/` and
  `ruff format --check backend/`.
- **Backend (pytest):** installs `requirements.txt` and runs `pytest` (incl. the
  `tests/contract/` response-contract harness).
- **Frontend (lint + types + tests):** `npm ci` + `npm run lint` +
  `npm run format:check` + `tsc -b --noEmit` + `npm test`.
- **API types (generated, in sync):** regenerates `backend/openapi.json` +
  `app/src/client` (`npm run gen:api`) and fails on `git diff` drift.

All jobs are "loud but not blocking" — failures show red but don't gate merge
unless the corresponding check is added to required-status-checks for `main`.

Pre-flight before pushing:

```bash
cd app && npx tsc -b --noEmit && npm run lint && npm run format:check && npm test && npm run build
cd ../backend && uv tool run ruff check . && uv tool run ruff format --check . && python -m pytest
# if you changed any backend schema:
cd ../app && npm run gen:api && git diff --exit-code ../backend/openapi.json src/client
```
