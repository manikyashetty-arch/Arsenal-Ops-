"""Postgres-backed integration tests for the workforce advisory lock.

These verify the H2 fix: the lock is owned by a dedicated Connection
separate from the ORM Session's connection, so per-entry ORM commits
(which can swap the Session's pooled connection) don't release or
"lose" the lock.

Gated by the ``WORKFORCE_PG_TESTS=1`` env var because they require a
running Postgres. Skipped otherwise (CI today is sqlite-only).

To run locally::

    docker compose up -d db
    WORKFORCE_PG_TESTS=1 \\
      DATABASE_URL=postgresql://arsenalops:arsenalops@localhost:5432/arsenalops \\
      python -m pytest backend/tests/test_workforce_advisory_lock_pg.py -v

The fixtures share a single engine pointed at the configured database.
Each test creates its own Session(s) and tears them down via the ORM,
without dropping tables — the lock test doesn't write to anything other
than ``pg_locks`` so leaving the schema untouched is fine.
