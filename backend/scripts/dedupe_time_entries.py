"""Dedupe TimeEntry rows created by rapid-click duplicate POSTs.

The "Log Hours" button used to fire on every click without disabling itself or
deduping on the backend, so a single user action could create many identical
TimeEntry rows. PROJ-333 was the worst case: 11 entries of 2h each = 22h on a
2h-estimated ticket.

This script collapses near-simultaneous identical entries:
  group_key = (work_item_id, developer_id, hours)
  Within each group, any rows logged within `--window-seconds` of an earlier
  row are considered duplicates of it and deleted.

Idempotency contract with the QuickBooks sync
=============================================
The workforce sync (`backend/services/workforce_sync.py`) writes a QB
TimeActivity Id back to ``TimeEntry.workforce_entry_id`` on each push.
A row with ``workforce_entry_id IS NOT NULL`` has a one-to-one mapping
to a QuickBooks record; deleting it orphans the QB record, and re-syncing
its unsynced dup would create a duplicate billable entry in QB.

This script honours that contract:

  - A synced row (``workforce_entry_id IS NOT NULL``) is NEVER deleted.
  - If a cluster contains exactly one synced row, that row is the keeper
    (overriding the "earliest is keeper" default); the other unsynced
    duplicates are deleted.
  - If a cluster contains MULTIPLE synced rows (an orphan-risk scenario
    that should never happen if the sync's ``workforce_entry_id IS NULL``
    gate is honoured), the entire cluster is skipped with a warning —
    operator must reconcile by hand.

After deletion, `work_items.logged_hours` is recomputed from the surviving
TimeEntry rows so the rollup column matches the source of truth.

Idempotent — safe to re-run; subsequent runs find nothing to do.

Usage:
    cd backend
    # Dry run first — prints what WOULD be deleted, changes nothing.
    python -m scripts.dedupe_time_entries --dry-run

    # Apply.
    python -m scripts.dedupe_time_entries

    # Tune the dedupe window (default 60s). Genuine logs from one user on one
    # ticket usually have minutes/hours between them; raise this if you have
    # legitimate burst-logging patterns.
    python -m scripts.dedupe_time_entries --window-seconds 30

    # Scope to one ticket while testing.
    python -m scripts.dedupe_time_entries --work-item-id 333 --dry-run
