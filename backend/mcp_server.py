"""MCP server for Arsenal Ops.

Mounts the Ops backend as an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server at ``/mcp`` so
Claude / AI agents can read Ops data through a standard, authenticated protocol.

Design (see .plans/enable-mcp-server-20260622-0945.md):

- **Transport:** stateless streamable HTTP (`stateless_http=True, json_response=True`)
  so there is no long-lived SSE connection held open against the single Render
  worker.
- **Auth:** the same HS256 JWT the REST API issues. `JWTVerifier` makes ``/mcp``
  an OAuth2.1 resource server that rejects un-tokened calls with 401. This is
  NOT token passthrough — we are the resource server, we issued the token, we
  validate it locally and never forward it upstream.
- **RBAC bridge:** inside each tool we read the validated token's claims, load
  the `User` via the shared `load_user_from_claims`, and enforce the existing
  capabilities + per-project access via `assert_capability` /
  `require_project_access` — so an agent never exceeds its user's UI
  permissions. Note the read tools are intentionally *stricter* than the REST
  read endpoints, several of which are auth-only with no per-project scoping;
  the tools always scope to what the caller can see in the UI.
- **Reuse, don't duplicate:** tools call the existing router/service read logic
  directly (route handlers are plain functions whose `db`/`current_user` are
  just `Depends` defaults we override), so there is no second copy of the query
  or serialization logic.
- **DB sessions:** tools run outside FastAPI's `Depends(get_db)` lifecycle, so
  each opens its own `SessionLocal()` (see `_caller_session`) to avoid leaking
  connections from the (5 + 10 overflow) pool.
