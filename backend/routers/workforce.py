"""Workforce / QuickBooks integration HTTP endpoints.

Split into two namespaces:

- `/api/admin/workforce/*` — admin actions. All require the
  `admin.workforce_connect` capability. Used by the Integrations tab in
  the admin UI.
- `/api/auth/workforce/callback` — the public OAuth callback that Intuit
  redirects the admin's browser to. Not gated by capability (the admin
  is mid-flow and isn't sending an Authorization header); instead it's
  protected by a signed, single-use `state` token bound to the admin's
  user id with a 10-minute TTL.

Token storage: this router NEVER returns tokens or ciphertext in any
response. All cryptography stays inside `services/workforce_oauth.py`.
The status endpoint uses `WorkforceIntegration.to_safe_dict()` which
explicitly redacts the token columns.

This is Phase 2 of the integration plan — connect/disconnect/status.
The QB API client (employees/customers/post_time_activity) and the sync
worker live in later phases; this file does not implement them.
