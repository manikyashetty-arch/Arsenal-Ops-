"""Refresh + read helpers for the cached QuickBooks Customer list.

Two surfaces:

- `refresh_workforce_clients(db, integration)` — fetches the full
  Customer list from QB, upserts it into `workforce_clients`, and
  soft-deactivates any row not present in the latest fetch. Called by:
    1. The OAuth callback right after a successful Connect (eager seed).
    2. The Saturday sync worker at run start (weekly refresh).
    3. The manual "Refresh clients" button on the Integrations tab.

- `list_active_clients(db)` — reads only `active=True` rows from the
  cache, sorted by name. Returns the same shape (`[{id, name}]`) the
  router used to return from the live fetch, so the picker is unchanged.

Why a cache rather than live calls:
  - Picker open should be free of Intuit round-trips (latency + rate limits).
  - Picker keeps working through transient Intuit outages.
  - Predictable refresh cadence — admin knows the list updates on
    Saturday, and can force-refresh in one click if needed.

Why soft-delete (`active=False`) rather than hard-delete:
  - A project may already be tagged to a customer that QB later
    deactivates. The project chip needs to keep rendering the name;
    soft-delete preserves the row, hard-delete would orphan it.
  - Pickers filter on `active=True`, so deactivated customers fall out
    of the dropdown automatically — no surface clutter.
