"""QuickBooks Online API client for the Workforce integration.

Three public surfaces:

- **Discovery:** `fetch_qb_employees`, `fetch_qb_customers`. Both return
  paginated full lists; used by the project-link picker and the sync
  worker's email → employee map.
- **Reference resolution:** `resolve_service_item`. Used at connect time
  (and lazily by the sync worker) to find the QB Item id for "Hours".
- **Write:** `post_time_activity`. The single mutation we make against
  QB; everything else is read-only.

Token handling: every public function takes `(db, integration)` and
calls `ensure_fresh_access_token` internally. Callers never deal with
access tokens directly — they don't need to know whether the token was
refreshed mid-call or what its expiry is.

Errors: we surface two typed errors that callers (the sync worker and
the OAuth router) want to distinguish:

- `QBRateLimitError` — Intuit returned 429. Sync worker should stop the
  current run and retry on the next cron tick (NOT spin in a retry
  loop, since rate limits are per-realm and we'd starve other syncs).
- `QBApiError` — any other non-2xx response. Sync worker records the
  error per-entry and continues; OAuth router fails open.
