- Use --> for connections
- Group related components with subgraphs
- Keep it clean and readable

ARCHITECTURE DESCRIPTION: {arch_desc}

ARCHITECTURE DIAGRAM:

{prd_context}
AVAILABLE DEVELOPERS:
{devs_str}
{timeline_context}

Create a comprehensive set of Jira tickets to implement this architecture. For each ticket:

1. Analyze the architecture components and PRD requirements
2. Break down into implementable tasks
3. Assign to the most suitable developer based on their role/responsibilities
4. Estimate story points and hours
{sprint_instructions}

IMPORTANT ASSIGNMENT RULES:
- Only assign a ticket to a developer if their role/specialization matches the task
- If no developer has the required specialization (e.g., testing, QA, DevOps), set assignee_name to "Unassigned"
- Examples: If there's no QA specialist, keep testing tickets unassigned. If there's no DevOps, keep CI/CD tickets unassigned.
- Always explain the assignment reasoning in assignee_reasoning field

Create tickets for:
- Infrastructure setup
- Frontend components
- Backend services/APIs
- Database setup and models
- Authentication/Authorization
- Testing
- Documentation
- DevOps/CI/CD

For each ticket provide:
- title: Concise, action-oriented title
- description: Detailed requirements and acceptance criteria
- type: epic/user_story/task/bug
- priority: critical/high/medium/low
- story_points: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, or 13
- estimated_hours: Realistic estimate
- assignee_name: Name of the developer (must match exactly from the list above), or "Unassigned" if no suitable developer exists
- assignee_reasoning: Why this developer was chosen, or why it's unassigned (e.g., "No QA specialist available")
- tags: Relevant labels
- dependencies: List of ticket titles this depends on
- sprint_number: Which sprint this belongs to (only if timeline provided)
