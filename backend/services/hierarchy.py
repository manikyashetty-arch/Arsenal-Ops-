"""Hierarchy validation for work items.

Mirrors the rules encoded on the frontend in
``app/src/lib/hierarchy/validateReparent.ts``. The frontend is the spec; this
module is the enforcement layer that protects the API against direct callers
that bypass the form.

Canonical model (Story / Task / Bug are siblings directly under Epic):

    Epic            no epic_id, no parent_id
    User Story      epic_id -> Epic (optional), no parent_id
    Task            epic_id -> Epic (optional), no parent_id
    Bug             epic_id -> Epic (optional), no parent_id

The ``parent_id`` column is retained on the model so this rule can be relaxed
later (e.g. sub-tasks under Story) by re-populating ALLOWED_PARENT_TYPES.
While disabled, any non-null parent_id assignment is rejected with a 422.

Cross-cutting rules (still applied to epic_id and any future parent_id use):
    - Parent must exist and live in the same project
    - No self-parent
    - Depth-1 cap: parent_id target must itself have no parent_id, and an
      item that already has children cannot itself be given a parent_id
