"""Workforce / QuickBooks sync worker.

`run_workforce_sync(db)` is the single entry point used by BOTH the
weekly cron (`scripts/run_workforce_sync.py`) and the manual "Sync Now"
button (`POST /api/admin/workforce/sync`). Same code path, same
guarantees — only the trigger differs.

Window
======
Both triggers sync the **Mon–Fri of the calendar week containing the
trigger** — see `current_work_week_window`. The Saturday cron and any
manual click on the same calendar week target the same range; a Mon–Fri
click syncs the partial Mon–through–today set (later weekdays simply
don't exist yet, so the eligibility query returns the partial result
and the next click — or the Saturday cron — sweeps the remainder).

The window is derived from `date.today()`, which uses the host's local
timezone. `TimeEntry.logged_at` is stored as naive UTC. Operators are
expected to run the backend with `TZ=UTC` (Render's default) so the
two coincide; a non-UTC host can shift week boundaries on the date
boundary. See `WORKFORCE_INTEGRATION_SETUP.md` and `REVIEW_RULES.md`.

Note: a Saturday cron that slips past midnight (runs on Sunday) advances
the week pointer and would target the next calendar week — by policy
that's an ops issue, not a worker concern. Idempotency
(`workforce_entry_id IS NULL`) keeps any missed entries eligible for a
manual re-run.

Concurrency
===========
Postgres advisory lock keyed on a hardcoded int. Two simultaneous
syncs (cron + manual click) won't both push the same TimeEntry. The
lock is released automatically when the session closes or the
transaction commits.

Idempotency
===========
Even if the lock fails (e.g. SQLite in tests), the sync is still
idempotent because the eligibility filter requires
`time_entries.workforce_entry_id IS NULL`. A TimeEntry that's already
synced has the QB id set and falls out of the queue.

Errors
======
- Rate-limit (429) from Intuit → stop the run gracefully. The
  partial progress is committed; next run picks up the rest.
- Per-entry API errors → log + count, continue with the next entry.
- Missing service item → fail the run cleanly with a clear message
  instead of pushing entries to QB with a null Item ref.

    Why we open a dedicated Connection instead of using the ORM Session:
    Postgres advisory locks are bound to the *physical* connection that
    acquired them. The ORM Session committing inside the sync (per-entry

    a different one on the next operation. A subsequent

    that doesn't hold the lock → unlock returns ``false``, the original
    connection silently keeps the lock until it cycles out of the pool,
    and the next sync sees a spurious "already running" until that
    happens (minutes, not days, but still wrong).

    We sidestep all of that by opening one Connection at lock acquire
