"""Weekly capacity calculation for developers — transfer-aware.

Used by:
  • /api/admin/developers/capacity   (across all projects, per developer)
  • /api/projects/{id}/workload      (within one project, per assignee)
  • /api/workitems/projects/{id}/hours-analytics   (per developer, scoped to project)

Week boundary: Saturday 00:00 → Friday 23:59 (UTC).

Attribution rules (per (developer, ticket) pair this week):
  • logged_this_week → sum of TimeEntry.hours where developer is this dev,
    ticket is this ticket, and logged_at falls in the week.
  • remaining_commitment → if this dev is the current holder at week end AND
    the ticket is not yet done/cancelled, add max(0, estimated - total_logged_to_date).

Bucket assignment (based on ticket's status at calculation time):
  • status == 'done' and completed_at within this week  → DONE bucket  (logged_this_week ONLY;
    earlier weeks' logged hours don't carry into this week's capacity)
  • status == 'in_review'                                → IN_REVIEW   (logged_this_week + remaining if current holder)
  • status == 'in_progress'                              → IN_PROGRESS (logged_this_week + remaining if current holder)
  • everything else                                      → not counted

A developer "had this ticket this week" iff they have at least one assignment span
in work_item_assignment_history that overlaps the week (or they logged hours on it
this week — same outcome).
