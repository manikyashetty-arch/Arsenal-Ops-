"""Per-developer Review-and-Submit timesheet service.

Two responsibilities, both scoped to *one* developer's Mon–Fri window:

  1. :func:`get_my_timesheet` — read the current week's entries grouped
     by QB Customer → Project, plus a separate "unlinked projects"
     bucket for hours on projects without a `workforce_client_id`. The
     dev's Review modal renders this verbatim.

  2. :func:`submit_my_timesheet` — push the dev's eligible entries to
     QuickBooks inline, returning per-entry success/failure. The dev
     clicks Submit; we set ``submitted_at`` on the picked entries, then
     POST each one through :func:`services.workforce_qb_client.post_time_activity`
     (the same call admin force-sync uses). Per-entry failures keep
     ``submitted_at`` set but ``workforce_entry_id`` NULL — the next
     click is a natural retry.

Why this lives next to :mod:`services.workforce_sync` rather than
inside it: the admin force-sync is a *batch* job over all developers,
with a result shape designed for email digests (totals + skip
summary). The dev submit is an *interactive* job for one developer,
with a result shape designed for the modal (per-entry rows + retry
hints). Keeping the two paths separate avoids shoehorning either UX
into the wrong shape, while both paths still share the same QB POST
helper, the same week-window function, and the same advisory lock —
so a dev submit and an admin force-sync can never push the same
TimeEntry concurrently.
